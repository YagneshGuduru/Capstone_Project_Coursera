# 🚀 ANALYZING AND MODELING ROCKET LAUNCH PATTERNS

Capstone project analyzing Falcon 9 launch data from the SpaceX API. Conducted data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualizations. Built and evaluated predictive classification models to uncover launch patterns, trends, and success factors, demonstrating practical knowledge and skills in data science.

## 📂 Project Workflow: 

## 1. Data Collection Stage

In this stage, I collected data for the project using various methods and tools.

### 🔹 Steps followed:
1. Identified reliable data sources related to the project objective.
2. Used APIs and web scraping to gather raw data.
3. Performed data validation to remove duplicates and inconsistencies.
4. Stored collected data in structured format (CSV).
5. Committed data collection scripts and raw data samples to GitHub for version control.

### 🧰 Tools Used:
- **Python** (for scripting)
- **Requests & BeautifulSoup** (for API calls & web scraping)
- **Pandas** (for data handling)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version tracking)

## 2. Data Wrangling Stage

In this stage, I cleaned and structured the collected data to prepare it for analysis and model training.

#### Steps Followed:
1. Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and reviewed its structure using overview methods (`info()`, `describe()`, etc.).  
2. Detected and handled missing or inconsistent values to ensure data quality.  
3. Used `value_counts()` to examine categorical distributions and understand class balance.  
4. Created new training labels derived from existing columns for classification purposes.  
5. Exported the cleaned and labeled dataset for use in the EDA stage.

#### Tools and Libraries Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Git & GitHub (for version tracking)
